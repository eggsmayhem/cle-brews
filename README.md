# Cleveland Brews
## Search Breweries in Cleveland, OH

This library's behavior is a bit tricky when it comes to the rendering lifecycle, such that I had to disable Stict Mode in development. Rendering maps is a quirky process I would like to learn more about. 

# Going forward

## Add unit testing

## New feature: cheapest brews
This feature will take advantage of the "cheapest beer/cheapest beer abv" fields I added to the custom Nodejs API I wrote for this app. This feature will enable a broke college student to enter the amount of money they have to spend, and search for local breweries based on how many of each brewery's cheapest beer (+20% tip) they would be able to buy with that money, as well as the beer's alcohol percentage.
